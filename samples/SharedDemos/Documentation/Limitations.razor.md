# Limitations

Currently we are aware of these limitations:

## Rules
- adding multiple rules on a component 
  - if one is valid, it will show the element
- implementation of the other validations result like disabled or enabled
- using the path notation with '@' for list data
 
 ## String

 - Support for pattern


 ## Datetime

 - Support for the notation in the json result like UTC etc.
